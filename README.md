# recipe-tracker-app

This project was designed to test my ability to work with rendering and state management using React.

For this project I demonstrated my skills with installing packages via NPM, running tests from the command line, writing React function components, using hooks like useState(), and debugging React code through console output.

The proper placement of usage of JSX and React functionality was an obstacle to complete with concise code. React management proved to be a difficult adversary.

Plans to come back and make better arrangements of code and JSX routing are in the works. 

React turns out to be my favorite interface for programming.
